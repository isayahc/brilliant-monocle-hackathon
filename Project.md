## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to demostrate a way to play table-top based games while using large language models (LLM) to:

- Keep track of the rules
- Validate and record game states
- Make decisions based on past states

These task has before been delagated to the players, and it could take a long time to understand the game long enough to do this. In addition these rules could potentially be difficult to implement in code because of the many potetial states of a game. With using a LLM to moderate games it allows enough flexibility as well as maintain the intergratity of the rules.

a large language model's (LLM) ability to interface with a user or users 

## Challenges Faced

### Monocle Device

#### Mechanical

- The glasses i used had too thick of a frame causing the clip to snap ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. I used crazy glue to patch it up.


### Software

- My computer is too slow for accurate real time speech-to-text. This causes a immersion breaking wait time. This could easily be fixed with an api or cloud computing device.
- It was diffucult to save the audio from the monocle to my computer initially. With the help of [my friends](https://github.com/alinayu03/BridgeAR/blob/main/networking/main.py) i was able to configure it.
- I unfortunately has unable to get some of the features i wanted to implement.

## Future Scope

In the future i want:

- The ability for multiplayer. An important aspect of games is competition and cooperation. This could be multiple Monocles interacting on the same device, or each monocle connecting to a server on the cloud from a computer or phone.
- I would like the monocle to display as much information pertaining to the game as possible. e.g, the current hand of a user. The current phase the user is in on thier turn, what items they can use. It would be cool for the monocle to display unicode.
- Have a list of prompts that pertain to which game the group wants to play. Any house rules can be added to the original prompt if needed.

## Demo

## Aditional Notes

Please refer to the readme for how to run this code.
