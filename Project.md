## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to demostrate a way to play table-top based games while using large language models (LLM) to:

- Keep track of the rules
- Validate and record game states
- Make decisions based on past states

These task has before been delagated to the players, and it could take a long time to understand the game long enough to do this. In addition these rules could potentially be difficult to implement in code because of the many potetial states of a game. With using a LLM to moderate games it allows enough flexibility as well as maintain the intergratity of the rules.

a large language model's (LLM) ability to interface with a user or users

## Problem Statement

There is a higher barrier of entry for playing and creating certain table top games. This could be because of the complixity of the rules, maintance of every piece, cost of buying board games. In addition, a lot of games constrain users to sitting around a table. These issues can prevent a lot of demographics from enjoying table top games, or even making thier own games.

## Solution

With the monocle and a LLM, the boring aspect of games can be automated.

## Impact

This is targeted to people who want to encourage groups of people to interact and learn while having fun. Wether it is teachers, community mangers or families.

## Challenges Faced

### Monocle Device

#### Mechanical

- The glasses i used had too thick of a frame causing the clip to snap ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. I used crazy glue to patch it up. In addition i made sure to use glasses with a skinny frame.

### Software

- My computer is too slow for accurate real time speech-to-text. This causes a immersion breaking wait time. This could easily be fixed with an api or cloud computing device.
- It was diffucult to save the audio from the monocle to my computer initially. With the help of [my friends](https://github.com/alinayu03/BridgeAR/blob/main/networking/main.py) i was able to configure it.
- I unfortunately has unable to get some of the features i wanted to implement.

## Future Scope

In the future i want:

- The ability for multiplayer. An important aspect of games is competition and cooperation. This could be multiple Monocles interacting on the same device, or each monocle connecting to a server on the cloud from a computer or phone.
- I would like the monocle to display as much information pertaining to the game as possible. e.g, the current hand of a user. The current phase the user is in on thier turn, what items they can use. It would be cool for the monocle to display unicode.
- Have a list of prompts that pertain to which game the group wants to play. Any house rules can be added to the original prompt if needed.
- (May have been added ) The ability to save from a state
## Demo

## Aditional Notes

Please refer to the readme for how to run this code.
